# Applying Super-Resolution to Sentinel 2 Imagery
### Alexander Vu and Ben Gaskill

## Description:
The goal of our project is to research, adapt, and fine-tune super-resolution deep learning frameworks to resample Sentinel-2 imagery from its native resolution of 10 meters up to 1.5 meters per pixel. Our main focus is on the WorldStrat super-resolution model, which we tested using multi-temporal stacks of input imagery for 6 selected sites across Zambia.

## Visualization of Data and Results:  
Please refer to the ![SuperResolutionVisualizations]() notebook for dynamic visualizations (as well as our ![presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NXxHIwHK3bESZhNmiMa6fwTGc-tXAnu_QI6w-GREb9Q/edit#slide=id.p). Below is a static visualization of our inputs and outputs.
